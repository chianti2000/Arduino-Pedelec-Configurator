1.30
- Introducing support for KM5s and rewrote J-LCD code
- Featuring an common API for King-Meter displays
- Added display_debug() and SERIAL_MODE_DISPLAYDEBUG/BLUETOOTH_MODE_DISPLAYDEBUG
- disable motor output at startup - there was a 100ms spike during setup routine at motor output
- slowly ramp PID integral part down to 0 when not pedaling instead of setting power setpoint to -60W. This could lead to malfunctions, e.g. if the current offset is configured wrong.
- added option to reset integral part instead of ramping down
